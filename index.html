		<h1>Roads Go Ever On</h1>
		<h3>by J. R. R. Tolkien</h3>

		<p>Roads go ever ever on,</br>
		Over rock and under tree,</br>
		By caves where never sun has shone,</br>
		By streams that never find the sea;</br>
		Over snow by winter sown,</br>
		And through the merry flowers of June,</br>
		Over grass and over stone,</br>
		And under mountains in the moon.</p>

		<p>Roads go ever ever on,</br>
		Under cloud and under star.</br>
		Yet feet that wandering have gone</br>
		Turn at last to home afar.</br>
		Eyes that fire and sword have seen,</br>
		And horror in the halls of stone</br>
		Look at last on meadows green,</br>
		And trees and hills they long have known.</p>

		<p>The Road goes ever on and on</br>
		Down from the door where it began.</br>
		Now far ahead the Road has gone,</br>
		And I must follow, if I can,</br>
		Pursuing it with eager feet,</br>
		Until it joins some larger way,</br>
		Where many paths and errands meet.</p>

		<p>The Road goes ever on and on</br>
		Down from the door where it began.</br>
		Now far ahead the Road has gone,</br>
		And I must follow, if I can,</br>
		Pursuing it with weary feet,</br>
		Until it joins some larger way,</br>
		Where many paths and errands meet.</br>
		And whither then? I cannot say.</p>

		<p>The Road goes ever on and on</br>
		Out from the door where it began.</br>
		Now far ahead the Road has gone.</br>
		Let others follow, if they can!</br>
		Let them a journety new begin.</br>
		But I at last with weary feet</br>
		Will turn towards the lighted inn,</br>
		My evening-rest and sleep to meet.</p>

		<p>Still 'round the corner there may wait</br>
		A new road or secret gate;</br>
		And though I oft have passed them by,</br>
		A day will come at last when I</br>
		Shall take the hidden paths that run</br>
		West of the Moon, East of the Sun.</p>
